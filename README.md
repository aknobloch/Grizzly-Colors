# Grizzly-Colors
Created: March 2017

=Description=
This implemented the Grizzly Colors app. The app features four sliders for 
RGBA values, and a color swatch with hexadecimal notation. As the user adjusts
each of the sliders, the color swatch and hexadecimal display updates to reflect
the changes. Furthermore, the text on the color swatch was required to 
adjust it's color according to the swatch color. For example, if the color
was a dark color, the swatch text would be light. This was implemented by 
a luminosity function.
